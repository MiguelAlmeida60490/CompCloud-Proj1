    Whether to create the resources the functions share with the web app in cc-proj: the
    resource group and the Cosmos DB account, database and containers.

    Leave it false if you have run "terraform apply" in cc-proj - this script then looks them up
    by name, and "terraform destroy" here leaves them alone. Set it to true only if you want the
    functions without the web app; after that, do not run "terraform apply" in cc-proj for the
    same suffix and region, since it would try to create them again.
